# Customer-Churn-Analysis


Customer churn analysis is a crucial process that involves studying and understanding customer behavior to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer attrition. By utilizing the provided key performance indicators (KPIs) as reference points, we can gain valuable insights into customer churn and make data-driven decisions to mitigate churn and improve customer retention.

I've Build a Dashboard by performing following KPI's :

♦ Count of Customers who Left within the Last Month:

This KPI provides an overview of the number of customers who churned during the most recent month. Monitoring this metric over time helps track the churn rate and identify any significant changes or trends.

♦ Services per Customer:

Analyzing the services each customer has signed up for enables us to understand the impact of different service offerings on customer retention. By identifying patterns among customers who churn, we can determine if specific services or combinations of services contribute to higher churn rates.

♦ Customer Account Information:

Examining various customer account information, such as contract length, payment method, monthly charges, and total charges, allows us to identify potential factors associated with churn. For example, customers with longer contract lengths or higher monthly charges may exhibit different churn behaviors compared to others.

♦ Number of Tickets Opened (Administrative and Technical:

This KPI helps gauge the level of customer satisfaction and support issues. A higher number of administrative or technical support tickets opened by customers who ultimately churned might indicate underlying problems or dissatisfaction that lead to churn.

♦Demographic Information:

Analyzing customer demographics, including gender, age range, and the presence of partners and dependents, helps identify if specific demographic groups have higher churn rates. Understanding demographic trends can help tailor retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

By closely analyzing these KPIs in customer churn analysis, we can identify patterns, root causes, and potential churn indicators. This knowledge enables businesses to develop targeted retention strategies, improve customer experiences, and optimize services to minimize customer churn and enhance overall customer loyalty.
